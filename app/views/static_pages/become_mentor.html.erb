		<p style="font-size:1.2em; padding-top:1em; text-align:center"> Becoming a mentor is an extremely rewarding decision. On top of guiding high school students, you can build personal relationships with younger, wide-eyed students and make a good amount of money for your special knowledge and position at a top school in North America. <br><br>
		Having braved the admissions process yourself – and come out successful on the other side – we know you will be able to guide high school students around all of the mistakes you made and allow them to reach their dream school.
