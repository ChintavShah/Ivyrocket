		Neither IvyRocket nor its partners, principals, or consultants, represent that the student will gain admission to any particular college or university and neither IvyRocket, nor its partners, principals, or consultants is responsible in any way for the student’s failure to gain such admission. Due to the ever increasing number of applicants and the declining number of admits, no student can be assured of admission at any particular college or university, no matter how strong that student is academically. IvyRocket specializes in helping students present their “best side” to universities and, as such, the student is able to maximize his/her chances for admission. IvyRocket provides percentage predictions on the student’s chances of being admitted to particular schools based on historical data and our experience in working with students. IvyRocket does not make any express or implied warranties, guarantees, assurances or representations to the Client with respect to the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, any implied warranty or condition is expressly excluded and disclaimed.
